# final-game
The main project goal was to create a more expansive combat simulator based off of the turn based combat system we created this year

The player will chose two of the availble classes, each with their own uniquie stats, and have them duke it out to see who is the strongest

While I mainly used the turn based combat enqine we developed, I also used conditions in order to create the character select

I will admit that my earlier idea for an RPG completly crashed and burned, but fortunrtly, me using our engine as a baseline gave me a new idea.

thebiggest thing I learned was to not have so much ambition that you can't get off of the ground. It can cause you to intimidate yourself.
